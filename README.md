# TIC_TAC_TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing either an "X" or an "O" in an empty square of the grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game, and if all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. It is a simple yet popular game that can be played by people of all ages.
